# Hybrid Native Web Component

I've wondered if it's possible to build a native web component that can be used with the `custom-elements` v0 and v1 spec in all major browsers. This is my exploration.

## Run

You can run each configuration at the same time.
| v0  | v1  |
|-----|-----|
| es5 | es5 |
| es6 | es6 |

```
npm i serve -g
cd build
serve -o
```
